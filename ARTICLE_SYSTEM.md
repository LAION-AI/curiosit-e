# Optimized Article System

This document describes the optimized article rendering system that has been implemented to efficiently handle a large number of articles while minimizing overhead.

## System Overview

The article system consists of two main components:

1. **Deno Fresh Application**: Handles the rendering of articles and the article index page
2. **Go Cluster Server**: Provides related article search functionality

## Key Optimizations

### Article Component Optimizations

- **Caching**: Implemented in-memory caching for transformed article content to reduce processing overhead
- **Efficient Content Transformations**: Streamlined HTML transformations with optimized regex patterns
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling for better reliability

### Article Index Page Optimizations

- **Caching**: Added caching for related articles to reduce API calls
- **Simplified Navigation**: Streamlined category navigation with a more efficient implementation
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: Optimized article grid for better performance across devices

### Code Cleanup

- Removed unnecessary code unrelated to article functionality
- Focused on preserving only the essential components for article rendering

## Docker Deployment

The system is configured for easy deployment using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Start the system
docker-compose up -d

# Stop the system
docker-compose down
```

### Configuration

- The main application runs on port 8000
- The Go articles server runs on port 3003
- Article files are mounted as read-only volumes

## Environment Variables

- `PORT`: Port for the main application (default: 8000)
- `STATIC_DIR`: Path to the articles directory (default: /app/static/articles)

## Performance Considerations

- The system is designed to handle a large number of articles efficiently
- In-memory caching helps reduce processing overhead
- Consider implementing a more sophisticated caching strategy for production use with very large article collections

## Maintenance

- To update the article content, simply modify the files in the `static/articles` directory
- No modifications to individual article files are needed when updating the system
